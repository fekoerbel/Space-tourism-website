  ### The challenge

  Users should be able to:

  - View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
  - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
  - View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

  ### Screenshot

  Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

  Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

  Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

  **Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**
